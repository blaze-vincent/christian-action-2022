    I connected with Christian Action when I could not afford to rent a place big enough for myself and six children.  
    For a brief time, we stayed in a shelter that was no longer in use.  
    I could not manage to buy a home on my own with the interest rates, security required, and down payment.  
    A close friend and mentor knew about Christian Action, and assisted me with the connection and getting things organized and going.  
    Christian Action helped me find a house, and made sure that all repairs were completed.  
    Christian Action secured a very low rate mortgage and closing cost.  
    When more repairs were needed that were over my budget, they assisted, and I repaid those amounts at a rate I could afford.  
    Christian Action has been such a blessing to myself and my children.  
    A couple of years ago, I made my last mortgage payment to Christian Action, and now I own my house.  
    This would not have been possible without the aid of Christian Action.  
    My children and I thank Christian Action very much.
